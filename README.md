WeExalate corp was the first attempt at launching their software business by a group of high school friends.

This was also one of my first projects when I started learning web dev, which shows in how I
have architected my pages and the content within.

I do not plan on continuing work on this, since WeExalate corp has been disbanded, however, I wanted to keep this
repository alive to remind myself where and how I started from 3 years ago.
